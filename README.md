This repository contains a simple example of a common Tcl syntax error related to the `if` statement.  The `bug.tcl` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected code.  The error arises from the omission of an `else` block in a conditional statement, a mistake that can easily be made by Tcl beginners. The solution showcases the correct usage of the `if` statement with a properly structured `then` and `else` block.
